A simple planetary motion simulation using Python and the Pygame library.


## Description

This project simulates the motion of planets in a gravitational field using basic physics principles. The simulation takes into account the gravitational force between planets, allowing them to orbit around each other.

## Features

- Planets are represented as circles with varying radii and colors.
- Gravitational forces between planets are calculated based on their masses and distances.
- Realistic initial conditions for the Sun, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus are provided.
- The simulation updates positions using a timestep and calculates new velocities.
- Orbits are drawn to visualize the path of each planet.
- Pygame library is used for visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/planet-simulation.git
